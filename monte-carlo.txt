This section describes how to use mathematical statistics, and in particular the Monte Carlo method, to solve the problem of average volume.
First, we calculate the volume using the standard formula: V=(1/6)∣det(B−A,C−A,D−A)∣.
Next, we convert to spherical coordinates by replacing x = r * sin(θ) * cos(φ) 
y=r * sin(θ) * sin(φ)
z =cos(θ) 
Next, we write down a huge determinant with cosines and sines of theta and phi, which needs to be integrated. 
The integral should be 12-fold, but some degrees of freedom are reduced and the integral is 6-fold, in which three integrals go from 0 to pi, 
and the other 3 from 0 to 2pi (azimuth and polar angles). The integrals are over d(\phi_1),  d(\phi_2) ,d(\phi_3) , d(\theta_1) , d(\theta_2) , d(\theta_3)
The calculations are monstrous, and the complexity of the calculations is growing at a catastrophic rate, so I will move on to describing a purely software-based method. This is the Monte Carlo method, and I will provide a script using this method.
first result while using monte-carlo script : 
E[|V|] ≈ 0.12020023463040627
E[V^2] ≈ 0.02489181665835261
sqrt(E[V^2]) ≈ 0.1577714063395285
